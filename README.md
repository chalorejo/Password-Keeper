This is, as the name suggests, a password keeper. This C++ program allows the user to enter an account with its corresponding password and it stores it inside a file.
Later on, once the user wants to view their password, the user must enter their PIN for the program to proceed. The program can also sort the accounts based on the category of the account (e.g. Google, Spotify).
